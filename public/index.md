# Sushi Card Generator

## Example
You can see an example Sushi card over [here](./sushi/example).

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder to hold your cards under the **/public/sushi** directory.
2. Copy the `_data.json` file from the **/public/sushi/example** directory and change the fields as appropriate.
Note that if you're adding a new language to the card, you'll need to modify **/harp.json** to add appropriate language info and include a (suitably licensed) logo in **/img**.
